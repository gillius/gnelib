This file contains a list of known bugs in GNE.  They are probably here
because we don't know how to fix them, or at least we are too busy to,
therefore if you can solve one of these problems, please contact the authors
to see if you can help.

If you got GNE from CVS, this file may only be updated on public releases --
  it won't be updated constantly as the CVS version changes things.

If an error occurs after onNewConn it isn't reported except through
  onDisconnect, and we have decided this is not acceptable anymore --
  onFailure should also be called.

Write error on a gracefull disconnect is possible if the TCP stream got
  killed before the ExitPacket was received by the reader thread.  I don't
  know how to fix this.

Extreme latency introduced due to threading in the Windows 9x kernels.  There
  seems to be a latency in 9x, and CPU speeds don't seem to matter as a
  500mhz CPU actually had less latency than a AMD XP1800+ CPU.  The introduced
  latency is very erratic between 10 and 150ms.  In XP this same latency is
  measured to be 0.3ms, and in Linux, 0.15ms.  I have spent days on this
  problem and I don't know how to fix it so if you have any ideas PLEASE
  contact the GNE authors at the GNE website!
