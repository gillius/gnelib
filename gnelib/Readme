Dependancies

The following things are needed for GNE:

  * ANSI C++ compiler
    + Out-of-the-Box for 
      - Windows: MSVC 6, MingW.
      - Linux: gcc 2.9x, 3.x.
      - Solaris: gcc 2.9x, 3.x using the GNU tools.
    + MSVC 4 or 5 might also work, and other *NIX as well, but testers are
      needed for this!
  * The HawkNL networking library from HawkSoft, version 1.42 or higher.
    The download link is on the left sidebar when you are in the HawkNL
    section.  Versions 1.4 and 1.41 may be used but are less stable and
    have a problem with stats reporting.
  * pthreads implementation (pthreads-win32 for Windows used for Windows),
    UNIX already has pthreads support.
  * A curses implementation such as ncurses will be needed to use GNE under
    a UNIX platform
