GNE
Game Networking Engine
http://www.rit.edu/~jpw9607/

  GNE is released under the terms of the LGPL.  It is a library for providing
networking for games.

The reference docs are generated by doxygen.  You can find them online, or
you may generate them yourself by using doxygen (a free program).

ALPHA NOTES -- IMPORTANT:
  This version is only an alpha version of GNE.  So that means take a
look at what the tests do and the capabilities of GNE.  Note that the API
can still change a lot from this release to the beta, at which time I plan
on freezing the API until final release.

  At this time most of the functions are implemented somewhat, but still a
large majority of the functions do not fully follow their post-conditions and
are minimal functionality -- for example you can send data, but it is not yet
throttled, connections do actually connect, but don't handshake or check for
errors, etc.  Also some of the examples are still not "perfect coding,"
espically the exhello example, assumes some of the internal workings of GNE
since I was trying to code in minimal functionality to get it started.

  That API that makes exhello need to know some things about how GNE works
will likely be changing, so I can get rid of the silly "delete this" and
detaching the own thread, which can cause some confusion from users of GNE.
