GNE
Game Networking Engine
http://www.rit.edu/~jpw9607/gne/

  Visit the site to get up-to-date links to things you need for GNE.

  GNE is released under the terms of the LGPL.  It is a library for providing
networking for games.

To learn more about what GNE will do visit:

The reference docs are generated by doxygen.  You can find them online, or
you may generate them yourself by using doxygen (a free program).

Dependancies

The following things are needed for GNE:

  * ANSI C++ compiler
    + Out-of-the-Box for 
      - Windows: MSVC 6, MingW.
      - Linux: gcc 2.9x, 3.x.
      - Solaris: gcc 2.9x, 3.x using the GNU tools.
    + MSVC 4 or 5 might also work, and other *NIX as well, but testers are
      needed for this!
  * The HawkNL networking library from HawkSoft, version 1.42 or higher.
    The download link is on the left sidebar when you are in the HawkNL
    section.  Versions 1.4 and 1.41 may be used but are less stable and
    have a problem with stats reporting.
  * pthreads implementation (pthreads-win32 for Windows used for Windows),
    UNIX already has pthreads support.
  * A curses implementation such as ncurses will be needed to use GNE under
    a UNIX platform

ALPHA NOTES -- IMPORTANT:
This version is only an alpha version of GNE. So that means take a look at what
the tests do and the capabilities of GNE. Note that the API can still change
significantly from this release to the beta, at which time I plan on trying to
freeze the API as much as possible until final release. At this current point
in the alpha though I'm not expecting much changes any longer on the core API
that is implemented now.

At this time most of the functions are implemented, but still a few of
the functions do not fully follow their post-conditions and are minimal
functionality -- for example you can send and recieve data, but it is not yet
throttled, connections do actually connect, but don't handshake or check for
all errors, etc.
