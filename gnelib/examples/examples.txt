Examples for GNE, in order of implementation, oldest first

exthreads -- shows the basics of creating, starting, and syncronizing with
  threads.

exuptime -- Very small example using Timer::getCurrentTime, which uses the
  rdtsc instruction where possible.  On many systems, this is time in CPU
  cycles since system start, so this is one way of getting system uptime.

extimer -- Shows usage of the Timer class.

exinput -- Shows usage of the Console class, also uses timers.

exhello -- Everyone knows the "Hello World" program.  Perhaps it's been coded
  too many times.  However, the GNE coders just plain don't care ;).
  This is an example to show the minimum code needed to connect and send
  data, in this case, "Hello Server (or Client)!" to the other end of the
  connection.
