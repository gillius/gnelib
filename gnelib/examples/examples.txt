Examples for GNE, in order of implementation, oldest first

exthreads -- shows the basics of creating, starting, and syncronizing with
  threads.

exuptime -- Very small example using Timer::getCurrentTime, which uses the
  rdtsc instruction where possible.  On many systems, this is time in CPU
  cycles since system start, so this is one way of getting system uptime.

extimer -- Shows usage of the Timer class.

exinput -- Shows usage of the Console class, also uses timers.

exhello -- Everyone knows the "Hello World" program.  Perhaps it's been coded
  too many times.  However, the GNE coders just plain don't care ;).
  This is an example to show the minimum code needed to connect and send
  data, in this case, "Hello Server (or Client)!" to the other end of the
  connection.  This version uses asynchronous sockets.

expacket -- Shows how to derive a new type of packet, and create the proper
  parsing functions interacting with RawPacket to allow GNE to use your packet.
  This example does NOT show how to use the packet over the network.
  See exhello for that.

exrawtest -- Basically a test of the RawPacket class.  Does show usage of the
  RawPacket class, but the usage in this case because this is a test uses the
  class is "hackish" ways.  The standard use of RawPackets is pretty trivial.

exaddr -- A small test for the Address class that also shows its usage.
