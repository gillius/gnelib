GNE 0.001 to 0.002
  Added a new example, exinput.
  Added character plotting functions to the Console class.
  Added an Allegro example, exballs.
  More functions in the Time class for working with Time objects.
  Basic MingW support.
  Removed GNE::exit(), when it was discovered that atexit and destructors are
    not called.  Now you must join all threads that might be running, for them
    to terminate properly.
  GNE and the Console portion shutdown automatically on exit now.  This was
    neccessary because the main thread might not be able to shutdown GNE if
    it exits before the other threads.
  Added the Console class, a file for basic cross-platform console functions
    used for the examples and for console-only based servers.  Examples have
    been updated to use this class.
  Added exuptime example.
  Added extimer example.
  Implemented Timer class.
  Added a buildall project for building the lib and all examples.
