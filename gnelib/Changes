GNE 0.003 to 0.004
  A few bug fixes.
  Added the SocketPair class to separate shared properties between Connection
    and SyncConnection.
  Removed the OnReceiveEventClass.  onReceive events are now forced to be
    "non-blocking" as there is now only a single event thread.  Multiple
    event threads were found to be overly confusing and complex to the
    developers and users, with very little to no potential benefits.  If you
    need to "block" in an event (other than onNewConn), spawn a new thread.
  Created a new class, Error, that replaces the Connection::FailureType enum,
    and allows the user some shortcuts and a better way to get a textual
    description of the error.

GNE 0.002 to 0.003
  Renamed the Time.h header file to TimeGne.h to resolve conflicts with the
    standard header file time.h.
  Implemented an internal debugging system that is started and configured on
    the user's demands.  The user can also use functions to write to this
    conditionally generated log file.  Each message has a type/level number
    assigned to it, so you can phase out certain messages.
  Fixed deadlock bug in event handlers.
  More work on error codes and error reporting.
  ConnectionEventGenerator now creates threads for onReceive events
  New class OnReceiveEventThread
  Implemented code in Connection to parse packets and use PacketStream
  Implemented the PacketStream class
  Added PacketParser namespace with packet parsing functions, which will be
    used internally by GNE, but the user could use them too (but won't need to).
  New example exrawtest.
  Entire library now in the GNE namespace.  Examples updated.  GNE and Console
    classes now namespaces instead of "static" classes.
  New example expacket.
  New example exhello.
  Implemented the RawPacket class.
  Major API changes/additions/deletions in the Connection classes.
    This API is still very much in developement and working, so do
    not rely upon it being fixed right now.
  Changed examples to use new Console functions and GNE::NO_NET.
  Added function in Console to set the window title where possible.
  Added function in Console to get width and height of window.
  Special version of Thread::sleep(int) for Windows.
  Implemented the Counter class, and updated extimer to use it.

GNE 0.001 to 0.002
  Added a new example, exinput.
  Added an Allegro example, exballs.
  More functions in the Time class for working with Time objects.
  Basic MingW support.
  Removed GNE::exit(), when it was discovered that atexit and destructors are
    not called.  Now you must join all threads that might be running, for them
    to terminate properly.
  GNE and the Console portion shutdown automatically on exit now.  This was
    neccessary because the main thread might not be able to shutdown GNE if
    it exits before the other threads.
  Added the Console class, a file for basic cross-platform console functions
    used for the examples and for console-only based servers.  Examples have
    been updated to use this class.
  Added exuptime example.
  Added extimer example.
  Implemented Timer class.
  Added a buildall project for building the lib and all examples.
